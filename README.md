# glitchy-growth

This mod is very early in alpha development, and I'm learning as I go :)


### Current Features
- New blocks, such as hollow logs and dead grass!
- Grass spreads and grows over time, make sure you look after your lawn.
- Healthy grass has a very small chance of growing flowers, which spread like mushrooms.
- Hollow logs are great for decoration, can be crawled through, and even waterlogged (no pun intended). They're great for dropshafts.


### Planned features:
- A complete overhaul of minecraft's natural systems, making the world more dynamic and alive.
- Plants can die if they don't get enough light and nutrients, including grass, leaves, saplings, etc
- Wood rot; wood that's exposed to too much water or humidity might start to rot. Wood can be finished with honeycomb to seal it from moisture and prevent rot. Sources of heat like torches, fireplaces, etc, will also prevent rotting - just don't accidentally burn your house down. Rot can be removed by right clicking with an axe.
- Tree felling; trees will fall over when being chopped down (configurable), or they might just fall over if they rot or die, or if they're struck by lightning.
- Regrowth; when a tree falls over or dies, it might drop saplings which can then grow into more trees, all without player intervention. A whole forest could be made from a single sapling and enough time.
